<h2 class="title">Introduction:</h2>

<p> <b>The field itself is an emerging area of computer sciences 
and a lot of work is underway in order to mature the concepts of this field. 
At this level we will however try to envelop some important aspects and basic 
concepts which will help the reader to get an insight into the type of topics that 
Artificial Intelligence deals with. 
We have used the name of the field i.e. Artificial Intelligence (commonly referred 
as AI) without any explanation of the name itself. Let us now look into a simple 
but comprehensive way to define the field. 
To define AI, let us first try to understand that what is Intelligence?</b></p>

<hr><hr><h2 class="title">What is Intelligence?</h2>

<img src="tech.jpg" class="about-us-image">

<p><b>If you were asked a simple question; how can we define Intelligence? many of 
you would exactly know what it is but most of you won’t exactly be able to define 
it. Is it something tangible? We all know that it does exist but what actually it is. 
Some of us will attribute intelligence to living beings and would be of the view that 
all living species are intelligent. But how about these plants and tress, they are 
living species but are they also intelligent? So can we say that Intelligence is a 
trait of some living species. All of you have experienced your college life. It was very easy for us to look at the 
timetable and go to the respective classes to attend them. Not even caring that 
how that time table was actually developed. In simple cases developing such a 
timetable is simple. But in cases where we have 100s of students studying in 
different classes, where we have only a few rooms and limited time to schedule 
all those classes. This gets tougher and tougher. The person who makes the 
timetable has to look into all the time schedule, availability of the teachers, 
availability of the rooms, and many other things to fit all the items correctly within 
a fixed span of time. He has to look into many expressions and thoughts like “If 
room A is free AND teacher B is ready to take the class AND the students of the 
class are not studying any other course at that time” THEN “the class can be 
scheduled”. This is a fairly simple one, things get complex as we add more and 
more parameters e.g. if we were to consider that teacher B might teach more 
than one course and he might just prefer to teach in room C and many other 
things like that. The problem gets more and more complex. We are pretty much 
sure than none of us had ever realized the complexity through which our teachers 
go through while developing these schedules for our classes. However, like we 
know such time tables can be developed. All this information has to reside in the 
developer’s brain. His intelligence helps him to create such a schedule. Hence 
the ability to think, plan and schedule demonstrate intelligence.</b>
